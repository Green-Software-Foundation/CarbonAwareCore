Carbon aware software does more when it can leverage greener energy sources, and less when the energy CO2 emissions are higher.  

The Carbon Aware SDK is a toolset to help you measure the carbon emissions of your software, in turn helping you **measure and reduce your software's carbon emissions**, and choose when and where you run your software to make it greener.

By knowing the carbon emissions of the energy that powers your applications, you and your organisation can leverage greener energy sources to reduce your CO2 emissions by:  

* Building  AI models when carbon emissions are lower
* Deploying software into the cloud in locations that have greener energy sources
* Running software updates at greener energy time windows 
* Using data to run hypothetical models to understand how you could start driving impact and reduce emissions, drive business cases for change, and create a greener future. 

Within the [Green Software Foundations Theory of Change](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/theory-of-change), we look at 3 pillars, that being **Knowledge**, **Tech Culture**, and **Tooling** as focus areas to drive this change.  The Carbon Aware SDK at its core sits firmly in the **Tooling** pillar, and also supports the other pillars, providing **Knowledge** through emissions data to inform change, and being core enabler for the **Tech Culture** for building carbon aware software.

Companies including UBS and Vestas have already deployed the Carbon Aware SDK to build greener software, and you can too!
